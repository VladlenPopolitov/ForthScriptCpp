<H2><A name="2">2.</A> Introduction</H2>

<H3><A name="2-1">2-1.</A> Description</H3>
<P>FORTHROBOTS  is a game based on computer programming. Unlike arcade
type games which require human inputs controlling some object, all strategy in
FORTHROBOTS must be complete before the actual game begins. Game strategy is
condensed into a Forth language program that you design and write. Your program
controls a robot whose mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other robots,
each running different programs. Each robot is equally equipped, and up to four
robots may compete at once. FORTHROBOTS is best played among several people, each
refining their own robot program, then matching program against program.</P>
<P>FORTHROBOTS consists of a Forth compiler, a virtual computer, and battlefield display
(text graphics only, monochrome or color). The FORTHROBOTS compiler accepts a
limited (but useful) subset of the Forth language. The Forth robot programs are aided by
hardware functions to scan for opponents, start and stop drive mechanisms, fire
cannons, etc. After the programs are compiled and loaded into separate robots,
the battle is observed. Robots moving, missiles flying and exploding, and
certain status information are displayed on the screen, in real-time.</P>

<H3><A name="2-2">2-2.</A> Intended audience</H3>
<P>FORTHROBOTS will most likely appeal to programmers (especially those who think
they can write the "best" programs), computer game enthusiasts, people wishing
to learn the Forth language, and those who are interested in compiler design and
virtual computer interpreters.</P>

<H3><A name="2-3">2-3.</A> Machine and software requirements</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Windows or Unix computer with C++11 or higher 
</UL>

<H3><A name="2-4">2-4.</A> User interface</H3>
<P>FORTHROBOTS does not use menus, windows, pop-ups, or any other user-friendly
interface. Since the emphasis is on designing and writing robot control
programs, FORTHROBOTS is started as a compiler might be started, from the OS
command line.</P>


<H2><A name="3">3.</A> Types of play</H2>
<P>FORTHROBOTS can either run one match (single play), in which the full screen,
realtime battlefield display is used, or several matches (match play), in which
only the name of the winner is printed after each match. Single play is the
default. Match play is intended to see how robot programs perform on the
average. Match play can consume several hours of computer time depending on the
number of matches and cpu cycle limit, and can be run overnight.</P>

<H2><A name="5">5.</A> Game parameters</H2>

<H3><A name="5-1">5-1.</A> Battlefield</H3>
<P>The battlefield is a 1,000 by 1,000 meter square. A wall surrounds the
perimeter, so that a robot running into the wall will incur damage.</P>
<P>The lower left corner has the coordinates x = 0, y = 0; the upper right
corner has the coordinated x = 999, y = 999.</P>
<P>The compass system is oriented so that due east (right) is 0 degrees, 90 is
north, 180 is west, 270 is south. One degree below due east is 359.</P>
<P><IMG src="compass.png" height="145" width="150" style="padding-left: 50px"
alt="[Compass system]"></P>

<H3><A name="5-2">5-2.</A> Robot offense</H3>
<P>The main offensive weapons are the cannon and scanner. The cannon has a range
of 700 meters. There are an unlimited number of missiles that can be fired, but
a reloading factor limits the number of missiles in the air at any one time to
two. The cannon is mounted on an independent turret, and therefore can fire any
direction, 0-359, regardless of robot heading.</P>
<P>The scanner is an optical device that can instantly scan any chosen heading,
0-359. The scanner has a maximum resolution of &plusmn;10 degrees. This enables
the robot to quickly scan the field at a low resolution, then use maximum
resolution to pinpoint an opponent.</P>

<H3><A name="5-3">5-3.</A> Robot defense</H3>
<P>The only defense available are the motor drive and status registers. The
motor can be engaged on any heading, 0-359, in speeds from 0-100 percent of
power. There are acceleration and deceleration factors. A speed of 0 stops the
motor. Turns can be negotiated at speeds of 50% and less, in any direction. Of
course, the motor drive can be engaged any time, and is necessary on offense
when a target is beyond the 700 meter range of the cannon.</P>
<P>Certain status registers provide feedback to the robot. The primary registers
indicate the percent of damage, and current x and y locations on the
battlefield. Another register provides current drive speed.</P>

<H3><A name="5-4">5-4.</A> Disabling opponents</H3>
<P>A robot is considered dead when the damage reaches 100%. Percent of damage is
inflicted as follows:</P>
<TABLE><TR>
  <TD>2%</TD>
  <TD>collision into another robot (both robots in a collision receive damage)
or into a wall. A collision also causes the motor drive to disengage, and speed
is reduced to 0.</TD>
</TR><TR>
  <TD>3%</TD>
  <TD>a missile exploding within a 40 meter radius.
</TR><TR>
  <TD>5%</TD>
  <TD>a missile exploding within a 20 meter radius.
</TR><TR>
  <TD>10%</TD>
  <TD>a missile exploding within a 5 meter radius.
</TR></TABLE>
<P>Damage is cumulative, and cannot be repaired. However, a robot does not loose
any mobility, fire potential, etc. at high damage levels. In other words, a
robot at 99% damage performs equally as a robot with no damage.</P>

<H3><A name="5-5">5-5.</A> Sample display</H3>
<P><IMG src="display.png" height="322" width="497" style="padding-left: 50px"
alt="[Battlefield display]"></P>

<P>Each status block shows the file name of the robot, the damage incurred, the
current scan degrees, and the speed and heading. Robots are represented on the
field by '1', '2', etc., according to the status block position. The number of
elapsed robot cpu cycles is shown at the bottom of the status blocks.</P>
<P>The FORTHROBOTS program can be stopped at any time, by using Ctrl-Break.</P>


<H2><A name="6">6.</A> FORTHROBOTS CPU</H2>
<P>The robot cpu is a standard Forth machine. Stack and memory is limited by Forth machine parameters chosen at copile time.</P>


<H2><A name="7">7.</A> FORTHROBOTS compiler and interpretator</H2>

<H3><A name="7-1">7-1.</A> Description</H3>
<P>The FORTHROBOTS compiler accepts an almost full subset of the Forth language. 
</P>

<H3><A name="7-2">7-2.</A> Features missing from standard Forth</H3>
<P> Output to screen, files operations, memory allocation operations.</P>



<H2><A name="8">8.</A> FORTHROBOTS Forth Intrinsic Function Library</H2>
<P>The intrinsic function library provides machine level control and certain
arithmetic functions. These functions do not consume any of the program code
space or data stack, except for the three words for call/return sequences. No
explicit linking is required to use any intrinsic function.</P>

<H3><A name="8-1">scan</A> ( resolution degree -- range )</H3>
<P>The scan function invokes the robot's scanner, at a specified degree and
resolution. scan() returns 0 if no robots are within the scan range or a
positive integer representing the range to the closest robot. Degree should be
within the range 0-359, otherwise degree is forced into 0-359 by a modulo 360
operation, and made positive if necessary. Resolution controls the scanner's
sensing resolution, up to +/- 10 degrees.</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   0 45   scan range ! \  scan 45, with no variance  and store to range variable
   10 365 scan range ! \ scans the range from 355 to 15 </PRE>

<H3><A name="8-2">cannon</A> ( range degree -- )</H3>
<P>The cannon function fires a missile heading a specified range and
direction. cannon() returns 1 (true) if a missile was fired, or 0 (false) if the
cannon is reloading. Degree is forced into the range 0-359 as in scan(). Range
can be 0-700, with greater ranges truncated to 700.</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   45 degree !    \ set a direction to test 
   2 degree @ scan dup 0 &gt; if \ see if a target is there */
     range ! cannon              \ fire a missile  
   else drop then                \ else drop range from stack </PRE>

<H3><A name="8-3">drive</A> ( speed degree -- ) </H3>
<P>The drive function activates the robot's drive mechanism, on a specified
heading and speed. Degree is forced into the range 0-359 as in scan(). Speed is
expressed as a percent, with 100 as maximum. A speed of 0 disengages the drive.
Changes in direction can be negotiated at speeds of less than 50 percent.</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   100  0 drive \ head due east, at maximum speed
   0   90 drive \ stop motion</PRE>

<H3><A name="8-4">damage</A> ( -- damagevalue)</H3>
<P>The damage function returns the current amount of damage incurred. damage
takes no arguments, and returns the percent of damage, 0-99. (100 percent damage
means the robot is completely disabled, thus no longer running!)</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   damage d !       \ save current state
                    \ other instructions 
   damage d @ = if  \ compare current state to prior state
     100 90 drive   \ robot has been hit, start moving 
     damage d !     \ get current damage again 
   then</PRE>

<H3><A name="8-5">speed</A> ( -- speedvalue)</H3>
<P>The speed function returns the current speed of the robot. speed takes no
arguments, and returns the percent of speed, 0-100. Note that speed may not
always be the same as the last drive, because of acceleration and
deceleration.</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   100 270 drive    \ start drive, due south 
                    \ other instructions 
   speed  0 = if    \ check current speed 
     20 90 drive   /* ran into the south wall, or another robot */
   then</PRE>

<H3><A name="8-6">loc_x</A> ( -- xvalue)<BR>loc_y (  -- yvalue)</H3>
<P>The loc_x function returns the robot's current x axis location. loc_x
takes no arguments, and returns 0-999. The loc_y function is similar to
loc_x, but returns the current y axis position.</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   50 180 drive              \ start heading for west wall
   begin loc_x 20 &gt; while
     repeat                  \ do nothing until we are close
   0 180 drive               \ stop drive</PRE>

<H3><A name="8-7">r_rand</A> ( limit -- randvalue )</H3>
<P>The r_rand function returns a random number between 0 and limit, up to 32767.
</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   360 r_rand degree !     \ pick a random starting point */
   0 degree @ scan range ! \ and scan */</PRE>

<H3><A name="8-8">r_sqrt</A> ( number -- value )</H3>
<P>The sqrt returns the square root of a number. Number is made positive, if
necessary.</P>
<PRE>Examples:
   x1 @ x2 @ - x ! \ compute the classical distance formula */
   y1 @ y2 @ - y ! \ between two points (x1,y1) (x2,y2) */
   x @ dup * y @ dup * + r_sqrt distance ! \ r_sqrt(x*x+y*y)</PRE>

<H3><A name="8-9">r_sin</A> ( degree -- value )<BR>r_cos ( degree -- value )<BR>r_tan ( degree -- value )<BR>
r_atan ( ratio -- degree )</H3>
<P>These functions provide trigonometric values. r_sin, r_cos, and r_tan, take a
degree argument, 0-359, and returns the trigonometric value times 100,000. The
scaling is necessary for compatibility with old robots code since the CROBOT cpu 
was an integer only machine, and trig
values are between 0.0 and 1.0. atan takes a ratio argument that has been
scaled up by 100,000, and returns a degree value, between -90 and +90. The
resulting calculation should not be scaled to the actual value until the final
operation, as not to lose accuracy. See <A href="#9-2">programming
examples for usage.</A></P>


<H2><A name="9">9.</A> FORTHROBOTS Forth Program Structure</H2>

<H3><A name="9-1">9-1.</A> Basic program structure</H3>
<P>FORTHROBOTS programs are not unlike other Forth programs. Other functions can be
defined, along with external variables.</P>

<H3><A name="9-2">9-2.</A> Sample robots</H3>
<P>Four FORTHROBOTS are provided as examples:</P>
<P><A href="rabbit.fth.html">rabbit.fth</A> is a simple robot that merely runs around the
field, randomly.</P>
<P><A href="counter.fth.html">counter.fth</A> uses a slow incremental scan to locate
enemies. Moves when hit.</P>
<P><A href="rook.fth.html">rook.fth</A> restricts its scanning to the four compass
points. Results in a very fast scan.</P>
<P><A href="snipper.fth.html">sniper.fth</A> is the most complex and devastating of the
sample robots. It sits in a corner so that it only has to scan 90 degrees.<BR>
Sniper's distance() and plot_course() routines are quite handy. Save them for
your programs. Also, note that the main scan routine will "back up" a few
degrees after a target has been found and fired upon. This should catch robots
trying to flee away from the direction you are scanning. If the target moves the
other way, the normal scan increment will find it.</P>

<H2><A name="10">10.</A> Implementation notes</H2>
<P>FORTHROBOTS is written entirely in 'C++'. 
The compiler section was developed with
the aid of the ForthScriptCPP class.
